# RSA

OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
This is an implementation of a RSA algorithm to study cryptography for the [Security Engineering] course. It was made at the Computer Science undergraduate program from University of SÃ£o Paulo (ICMC - USP).

HOW TO COMPILE
--------------------------------------------------
```bash
   1. Clone repository: https://github.com/wesjrock/EngSegCripto.git
   2. python main.py [e|d] [input_file]
   
   e: to encrypt
   d: to decrypt
   
   Examples:
   * encryption: python main.py e meu_texto.txt
   * decryption: python main.py d encrypted.txt
   
```
